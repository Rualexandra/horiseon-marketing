# horiseon-marketing

For this project I modified starter code to create an application that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

# How it works:

Go to the application so ensure the webpage meets accessibility standards. This can be done by viewing the source code, then find the semantic HTML elements.
Look at the structure of the HTML elements and you will find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. If you view the image elements, you will find accessible alt attributes. If you view the heading attributes, they fall in sequential order. Look at the title element to find a concise, descriptive title.
